# 3D Draw

To contain the Arduino and the fingerprint reader I designed a box that makes everything easy to handle and carry.

## General structure

The structure of the container has been designed to be able to contain, in the [lower part](#bottom), the [Arduino](#arduino) with its pinout and the connection solders with the reader. The [fingerprint reader](#fingerprint-reader) will then be held in place between the [stand](#support) and the [top cover](#top).
