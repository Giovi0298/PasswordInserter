# Arduino Code

The Arduino code manages the fingerprint reader and emulates the keyboard to enter the password assigned to that fingerprint.

## General structure

As mentioned above, the firmware will consist of 3 sections through which it will:

- [manage the fingerprint reader to indicate when it is in the enrollment phase and when instead a fingerprint is being read for entering a password;](#fingerprint-reader-management)
- [manage password storage in the EEPROM and recovery when a fingerprint is read;](#eeprom-management)
- [emulate the keyboard to write the password identified during the fingerprint letter.](#keyboard-emulation)
