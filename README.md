# PasswordInserter

Password inserter with Arduino and fingerprint

The project is divided into 3 parts: the code for the Arduino, the password setup software, and the case to be 3D printed.
Each is quickly described in the following sections and more specifically in the relative document.

## [Arduino Code](./Arduino_Code/README.md)

The Arduino code manages the fingerprint reader and emulates the keyboard to enter the password assigned to that fingerprint.

## [Configuration Software](./Configuration_Software/README.md)

The configuration software interacts with the Arduino to enter new passwords or change existing ones and manage the assignment to the relative fingerprints.

## [3D Draw](./3D_Draw/README.md)

To contain the Arduino and the fingerprint reader I designed a box that makes everything easy to handle and carry.
